Since I was little I have always been curious to know how things worked, how they were made and if I could make them into something new. I was captivated by Legos and how I could build something, break it and rebuild it into something better while other girls my age were playing with dolls. Growing up, I’ve become more and more of a geek for gadgets and gizmos as Technology fascinated me so much more than regular kid's toys.

Accelerate to 2017 and, after five years of working in Merchandising, I realised that it is not the world of Fashion that gets me excited, but software development and the challenge of building new things by coding. All of my free time was spent online watching tutorials to learn the basics of coding, and as my confidence grew and I quickly got introduced to the the live tech community attending various meet-ups and in particular [Codebar]( https://codebar.io/).

After a few months of weekly Codebar sessions, I quit my job. I made that life-changing decision to go for what I really want and that's to be a successful Software Developer.  So I have joined [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) on a 16-week highly intensive and selective Web Developer Bootcamp to take me from novice to software developer.

## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career, I have developed my communication skill by liaising with various suppliers on a daily basis and attending regular buying appointments. Communication has been a key factor to the department's success as it created a better working relationship not only with the brands but also with my internal teams.

#### Adaptability

During my career at ASOS, I have had the chance to work with several different teams. One of the most important skills I have learnt is adaptability and flexibility. Moving from a team to a new one is generally quite daunting, however it is the best experience I've had. Getting out of my routine, working with different people and learning people's way of working while bringing my own is the best way to progress.
