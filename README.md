Since I was little I have always been curious to know how things worked, how they were made and if I could make them into something new. I was captivated by Legos and how I could build something, break it and rebuild it into something better while other girls my age were playing with dolls. Growing up, I’ve become more and more of a geek for gadgets and gizmos as Technology fascinated me so much more than regular kid's toys.

Accelerate to 2017 and, after five years of working in Merchandising, I realised that it is not the world of Fashion that gets me excited, but software development and the challenge of building new things by coding. All of my free time was spent online watching tutorials to learn the basics of coding, and as my confidence grew and I quickly got introduced to the the live tech community attending various meet-ups and in particular [Codebar]( https://codebar.io/).

After a few months of weekly Codebar sessions, I quit my job. I made that life-changing decision to go for what I really want and that's to be a successful Software Developer.  I have now recently graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 16-week highly intensive and selective Web Developer Bootcamp that took me from novice to software developer.

## Skills

#### Communication

My communication skills were highly praised by my team members, always giving clear and rational thoughts or suggestions to problems, whilst ensuring the rest of my team can express themselves as well and don’t feel left out. Communication is important with your team, but so is having a good relationship with people outside the business. My previous roles have enabled me to develop those skills by maintaining high professionally and amicable relationships with external suppliers.


#### Adaptability

During my career at ASOS, I have had the chance to work with several different teams. One of the most important skills I have learnt is adaptability and flexibility. Moving from a team to a new one is generally quite daunting, however it is the best experience I've had. Getting out of my routine, working with different people and learning people's way of working while bringing my own is the best way to progress.

#### Persistence

My persistence and courage in what I can achieve is what has got me here today. Whilst I love taking on new challenges head-on, they are always risk calculated and difficulties faced with hard work to overcome them.

#### Fast learning

My ability to absorb and use information efficiently is a capability that I am proud of having. During my final project at Makers Academy, my team and I worked on building a web application using 12 new technologies, most of which I had to learn from scratch and we succeeded in creating a great product within the two-week timeframe.
